Neural-Network-Simulation in C++
================================

This is a demo application of neural network simulation in C++.
Neural network is trained in Matlab and weights and bias are exported to files.

Sample data is `chemical_dataset` available in Matlab.
The neural network has one hidden layer with 8 nodes.

With data of input and layer weights as well as bias, it is easy to simulate it in C++ uses matrix operation.
